# Road Accident Severity Prediction Model 🚦

This project uses a linear regression model to predict road accident severity based on features such as speed limit, weather, road surface, lighting conditions, and number of vehicles involved.

## ✅ Files Included
- `Road_Accident_Severity_Model.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with step-by-step code
- `sample_road_accidents.csv`: Sample dataset used for training
- `accident_severity_model.pkl`: Trained model saved with `joblib`
- (Optional) Screenshots of results and predictions

## 🔍 How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset when prompted.
3. Train the model, predict severity, and download the model file.
4. Use the sample prediction section to test new data.

## 🧠 Why This Matters
This model can help analyze accident patterns and provide insights for improving road safety in underdeveloped countries by identifying risk factors early.
